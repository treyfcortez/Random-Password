# Random Password

## This page is meant to generate a random password for anyone looking for a secure password. The user has the option to include or not include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers in their secure password. If the user fails to accurately select criteria, they will be told through alerts.

I used this website for any problems with syntax that I faced. https://www.w3schools.com/

To select a license for my README, I used this website. https://choosealicense.com/

I followed this guide to structure my README. https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide

My bootcamp TA Tom Gold helped me with the if statements code from lines 71 to 88 since I was having trouble making my code choose if the user wanted to user a specific type of character or not.
